//! # LibOSDP - Open Supervised Device Protocol Library
//!
//! This is a cross-platform open source implementation of IEC 60839-11-5 Open Supervised Device
//! Protocol (OSDP). The protocol is intended to improve interoperability among access control and
//! security products. It supports Secure Channel (SC) for encrypted and authenticated
//! communication between configured devices.
//!
//! OSDP describes the communication protocol for interfacing one or more Peripheral Devices (PD)
//! to a Control Panel (CP) over a two-wire RS-485 multi-drop serial communication channel.
//! Nevertheless, this protocol can be used to transfer secure data over any stream based physical
//! channel. Read more about OSDP [here][1].
//!
//! This protocol is developed and maintained by [Security Industry Association][2] (SIA).
//!
//! ## Getting started
//!
//! A device complying with OSDP can either be a CP or a PD. There can be only one CP on a bus
//! which can talk to multiple PDs. LibOSDP allows your application to work either as a CP or a
//! PD so depending on what you want to do you have to do some things differently.
//!
//! LibOSDP creates the following constructs which allow interactions between devices on the OSDP
//! bus. These should not be confused with the protocol specified terminologies that may use the
//! same names. They are:
//!   - Channel - Something that allows two OSDP devices to talk to each other
//!   - Commands - A call for action from a control panel (CP) to peripheral device (PD)
//!   - Events - A call for action from peripheral device (PD) to control panel (CP)
//!
//! The app starts by defining a type that implements the [`Channel`] trait; this allows your
//! devices to communicate with other osdp devices on the bus. Then you describe the PD you are
//!   - talking to on the bus (in case of CP mode of operation) or,
//!   - going to behave as on the bus (in case of PD mode of operation)
//! by using the [`PdInfo`] struct.
//!
//! You can use the `PdInfo` (or a vector of `PdInfo` structs in case of CP mode) to create a
//! [`ControlPanel`] or [`PeripheralDevice`] context. Both these contexts have a non-blocking
//! method `refresh()` that needs to called as frequently as your app can permit. To meet the OSDP
//! specified timing requirements, your app must call this method at least once every 50ms.
//!
//! After this point, the CP context can,
//!   - send commands to any one of the PDs (to control LEDs, Buzzers, Input/Output pins, etc.,)
//!   - register a closure for events that are sent from a PD
//!
//! and the PD context can,
//!   - notify it's controlling CP about an event (card read, key press, tamper, etc.,)
//!   - register a closure for commands issued by the CP
//!
//! You can find a template implementation for CP app [here][3] and PD app [here][4].
