//! The OSDP specification defines that communication between OSDP devices
//! happen over an RS-485 connection. For testing and development purpose this
//! can be limiting so LibOSDP defines a notion called "Channel" which is a
//! software representation (abstraction) of the physical transport medium.
//!
//! Since RS-485 is stream based protocol, we can think of it to be  something
//! that we can read from and write to (which in turn is Read and Write traits
//! in rust). This allows us to run OSDP devices over many IPC schemes such as
//! Unix socket and message queues.
//!
//! This module provides a way to define an OSDP channel and export it to
//! LibOSDP.
